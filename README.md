# Fundamentals
My search for the ultimate truth of life. Core concepts we can apply to our daily lives.

* [ ] **Luck** -
  + https://www.codusoperandi.com/posts/increasing-your-luck-surface-area ( L = D * T, where L is luck, D is doing and T is telling. )
  + https://github.com/tarasowski/philosophy/blob/master/2-summaries/how-to-get-rich.md
* [ ] **Simplicity** (everyone speaks about but no one defines it -> needs to be defined vs. complexity)
  + Essential complexity vs. Accidental Complexity [link](https://www.simplethread.com/why-does-it-take-so-long-to-build-software/)
  + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet
  + https://m.signalvnoise.com/conceptual-compression-means-beginners-dont-need-to-know-sql-hallelujah/
  + Fighting complexitiy: modularity / abstractions
* [ ] Divergence <> Convergence (math, design thinking, group dynamics, company culture)
* [ ] Abstractions (how to think in abstractions to become more productive -> thinking in black boxes?)
* [ ] Interfaces (the world is full of interfaces, chips have interfaces, teams have interfaces, political parties have interfaces)
* [ ] Composition / Decomposition (Descartes Method)
* [ ] Systems (a business is a system, but how to build a system)
* [ ] Dichtonomy of Control (Echiridion of Epictetus)
* [ ] Leverage (Archimedes application to business, life)
* [ ] First Principles Thinking (Descartes Method - Aristotles)
* [ ] Determinism (functions, people, systems)
* [ ] Repetition (in any sense from learning to repetitive work -> the effect of repetition on our lives?)
* [ ] Cyclicity (awake -> sleep -> awake -> sleep || birth -> death -> birth -> death)
* [ ] Concurrency, Parallelism, Asynchronous (map our behavior to machines and vice versa)
* [ ] Encoding, Decoding (encoding thoughts to paper and decoding paper to thoughts)
* [ ] Storytelling, Narratives (the importance in our lives)
* [ ] Entropy (in organizations, personal development, software systems -> everything becomes unorganized, high level of disorder)
* [ ] Experience (what role plays experieince in learning, doing and understanding stuff? -> the more you do the faster you learn e.g. getting to know many different technologies in computer science is better than specialization on only one technology -> my hypothesis)
* [ ] Presentations (how to speak)
* [ ] First-touchpoint Phenomena (how to dress)
* [ ] Pareto (the unequal distribution of life - application to business, systems, life)


# Todo
* [ ] Find the proper name for a phenomena where in a company there are people with high-energy and want to do things all the time but don't know what to do it they are taking the wrong direction. Пример Альтгаузен.
* [ ] Find a name for a phenomena where people inside of the company / group optimize everything to their personal goals. How to make these people productive, you need to build a structure that aligns to their personal goals and the compan itself. Ravikant was talking about (somehting with agent)
* [ ] Work out each core concept for day to day application
