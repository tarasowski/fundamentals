# Fundamentals
My search for the ultimate truth of life. Core concepts.

* [ ] Abstractions (how to think in abstractions to become more productive -> thinking in black boxes?)
* [ ] Interfaces (the world is full of interfaces, chips have interfaces, teams have interfaces, political parties have interfaces)
* [ ] Composition / Decomposition (Descartes Method)
* [ ] Systems (a business is a system, but how to build a system)
* [ ] Dichtonomy of Control (Echiridion of Epictetus)
* [ ] Simplicity (everyone speaks about but no one defines it -> needs to be defined)
* [ ] Leverage (Archimedes application to business, life)
* [ ] First Principles Thinking (Descartes Method - Aristotles)
* [ ] Determinism (functions, people, systems)
* [ ] Repetition (in any sense from learning to repetitive work -> the effect of repetition on our lives?)
* [ ] Cyclicity (awake -> sleep -> awake -> sleep || birth -> death -> birth -> death)
* [ ] Concurrency, Parallelism, Asynchronous (map our behavior to machines and vice versa)
* [ ] Encoding, Decoding (encoding thoughts to paper and decoding paper to thoughts)


# Todo
* [ ] Work out each core concept for day to day application
